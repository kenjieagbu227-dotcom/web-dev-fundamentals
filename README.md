 🪄 Introduction
Welcome to the **Web Development Fundamentals Course**!  
In this guide, you’ll learn how websites are created, styled, and made interactive.  
No prior coding experience needed — just curiosity and a browser.



 🌍 How the Web Works
Before coding, understand how websites reach users.

- **Client** → Your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- **Server** → Where your website lives (like GitHub Pages or Netlify)
- **HTTP/HTTPS** → The protocol that transfers data
- **Frontend vs Backend**
- *Frontend* — what users see (HTML, CSS, JS)
  - *Backend* — logic and database behind the scenes (Node.js, PHP, etc.)
